# Invoice Maker

##### <u>Description</u>

A simple Python script which can generate an invoice for your services or your products. It uses the [invoice-generator-api](https://github.com/Invoiced/invoice-generator-api) to make programmatically whatever invoice you like with as many items as you want. You can check out all the features of the invoice in the Github repository.

##### <u>Usage</u>

```bash
python invoice_maker.py name_of_csv_file
```

* The script works for Python __3.6__ and later.

* Make sure you have installed all the python requirements before you procced with executing the script. You can install all the requirements with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` . 

* You can execute the script with an optional argument, the name of the csv file. If you don't pass any arguments the script will execute with the default `invoices.csv` file.
